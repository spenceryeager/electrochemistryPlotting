# Electrochemistry Plotting Suite

This repository contains programs that can be used to plot and calculate various electrochemical information. The end goal of this project is to implement a GUI that can easily step through all calculations and plots. 

As of now, these programs are taylored for use with [CH Instrument, Inc](http://chinstruments.com/) potentiostats. I don't have any other kind of potentiostat, so as of now I cannot implement cross compatibility with other instrument brands.
